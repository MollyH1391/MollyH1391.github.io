## Summary of WowDin's Development and Achievements
WowDin is an **online food ordering platform project that replicates a real-life website**, which was completed within three-month in a seven-month microsoft funded bootcamp. The project includes a platform administrator, store management, and ordering web pages, providing a complete shopping process. This article will summarize the important technical details of the **Order module** and showcase the achievements.

The project was developed using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, with a layered architecture of **Repository Pattern + Service Layer**. The front-end utilizes JavaScript and Vue, with data retrieved through API requests using Fetch/Axios, and the back-end utilizes LINQ queries for CRUD operations. Notion was used as a project management tool to enhance schedule management and team collaboration efficiency. Additionally, GitHub and Azure DevOps were used for version control and CI/CD pipeline to ensure application quality.

**Selenium** was used for web testing, with test methods written to simulate user behavior, increasing testing efficiency and reducing the likelihood of human error. Finally, Azure DevOps **blue-green deployment** was utilized to enhance rollback capability and reduce risk when adding or modifying the application.
